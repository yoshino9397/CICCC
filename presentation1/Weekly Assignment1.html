	<h2>Vietnamese culture is</h2>
	<p>one of the oldest in Southeast Asia and is heavily influenced by the Chinese culture. After Vietnam attained independence from China in the 10th century, the country began to expand southwards which led to the incorporation of elements of the Champa and Khmer cultures into the Vietnamese culture. <br><span class="p1">L</span>ater French colonial rule in Vietnam introduced the Western culture to the country and led to the spread of Catholicism and the adoption of the Latin alphabet. Once the communist regime started in Vietnam, several restrictions were placed over cultural exchanges with the Western civilization and instead exposure to the cultures of other communist nations like Cuba, Soviet Union, and others was encouraged.<br><span class="p2">D</span>espite the changes over the years, some elements of the Vietnamese culture like the veneration of the ancestors, respect for family values, devotion to study, etc., remained intact.

<div class="para4">
<p><span class="span4">Making 1kg of lotus tea</span> needs 200 grams of stamen and pistil or about 1,000 lotus flowers. The mixture goes through a special marinating process before being dried and marinated again for seven times in order to let the lotus scent and taste soak into the tea. This long process is why lotus tea is one of the most expensive teas in Vietnam.Each lotus tea maker has their own secrets and process. Their tea is completely handmade and they don't use any additional ingredients.They have regular customers who have been using our tea for years and making lotus tea is a way of preserving one of Hanoi's oldest crafts.</p>
