  <p class="text">Vietnam, many years ago, was under the control of France. <br>The country’s inclination towards coffee came from the habits of the French rulers. <br>The numerous coffee plantations and the cafes that you find in Vietnam are all remnants of the culture that the French had introduced many hundreds of years ago. Vietnam is famous for its Robusta coffee beans, which lends the unique, bitter taste to the coffees here.</p>

<p>Einspänner is a classic Viennese coffee that combines espresso and hefty amounts of whipped cream on top. The drink was named after one-horse-drawn carriage. Allegedly, this type of coffee was ideal for the coachmen because the cream would keep the coffee warm and would prevent spillage.
<br>Einspänner is usually served in a tall glass, and it can be dusted with icing sugar or cocoa powder. Traditionally, it is not stirred, and the coffee should be slowly sipped through the whipped cream.</p>

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica">
  Arabica</a> has two main varieties, Typica and Bourbon. In Canephora, we drink the variety called Robusta. This is why the term Robusta is generally used for this entire variety of coffee. <br>In effect, coffee beans have been divided into two main types – Arabica and 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_canephora"> Robusta</a>. The main difference, besides being different species of the same plant family, comes down to flavour and characteristics of the actual bean.</p>

<div class="last">
<p>Have you ever been to Italy? Speaking of coffee in Italy, it's espresso! While most American coffee drinkers will simply drink any coffee concoction as they please, Italians drink certain beverages at certain times of day.<br> For instance, cappuccinos are generally reserved for breakfast—not to be ordered after 11:00 a.m. A macchiato is traditionally enjoyed as a bit of an afternoon pick-me-up and espresso is served after dinner. Also, try to stay away from ordering a coffee to-go. Most cafés in Italy are counter service or table seating only so try to keep that in mind.</p>
